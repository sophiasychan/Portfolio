        <p class="bio-text">
          My name is <strong>Sophia Chan</strong> and I am a Singaporean PhD graduate specialising in using nanomaterials to improve diagnostics and therapeutics.
          I love chemistry and am excited about creating unique solutions to improve the healthcare landscape.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Even as a kid, I have always been curious.</p>
      <p>
        I have always wondered why the colours in the sky were different when the sun sets, 
        or how cakes seem to rise but only when you put them in the oven,
        or why crystals sparkle differently but only in the light?
        It is clear now that "why" and "how" questions led me down the road of chemistry, and carried me through my education at the University of Edinburgh.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, I asked myself the following question: How can we use chemistry to improve cell detection and monitoring to improve the safety of treatments and patient quality of life?
        And <strong>BOOM</strong>! I was strapped onto the rollercoaster of research, screaming for dear life. 
        Just like any thrilling rollercoaster, some parts are slower, while other parts are fast and furious. And a good rollercoaster always has twists and turns. 
        I have learnt so much from my experience and enjoy solving healthcare questions using chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past 5 years, I have collaborated with fellow lab members and external researchers to break down this very question to uncover creative solutions with different perspectives.
        We were able to consolidate our findings into 2 first-author peer-reviewed publications, and presented this work at 3 international conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        My PhD adventure gave me opportunities to live the life of a multi-disciplinary scientist; I worked with various mammalian cell cultures, fabricated and characterised conductive nanomaterials, applied electrical testing methods and used analytical techniques to improve treatment safety.
        As the first PhD candidate in the group, I established and maintained cell cultures and experimental protocols, keeping detailed documentation.
        I also had daily responsibilities in lab management and organisation, purchasing and documenting inventory, and had the opportunity to mentor and train junior PhD candidates.
        Currently, I'm venturing into a new scientific adventure - single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. 
        For more information, you can find my resume <a href="./assets/pdf_files/CV_SophiaChan2022.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm taking a break from my PhD adventure, you can find me exercising, baking, embroidering or listening to podcasts. 
        I also love learning and improving myself, so I created this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      </p>

          <p class="publication-author"> <b>Chan, S. S. Y.</b>, Go, S. X., Meivita, M. P., Lee, D., Bajalovic, N., Loke, D. K.</p>

          <p class="publication-details">
            Advancements in technology are enabling early cancer treatments, improving patient survivability in some types of cancers. 
            Electrothermal cancer therapy offers numerous advantages such as high efficiency and minimal invasiveness. However, traditional electrothermal nanoagents has been limited by unresolved concerns including poor cell-selectivity and weak contrast in ablation efficiency between healthy and cancer cells. 
            Here, we control thermal distributions of cell systems using combined electrical-pulse carbon one-dimensional (1D-) nanomaterial platforms via Joule heating effects. 
            We then proposed the electrothermal ablation of cancer cells using integrated alternating-current (AC-) pulse carbon-nanotube (CNT) platforms. 
            Electrothermal simulations reveal an increased peak temperature for an extended stimulation time within the cell layers in the presence of CNT. 
            Moreover, experiments show a significant difference in CNT biocompatibility between healthy breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells and luminal breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. 
            Additionally, electrothermal ablation was observed to be enhanced in MCF-7 cells, while cell viability was maintained in MCF-10A cells under the same conditions. 
            Furthermore, a ∼68% decrease in cell viability was achieved after applying AC pulses, above an average of ∼40% decrease in cell viability for existing carbon-based photothermal nanoagents without additional chemotherapeutic drugs. 
            This previously unreported combination of CNT nanomaterials and electrical stimulation represents an approach to unlocking the ultra-efficient electrothermal ablation of MCF-7 cells and provides a promising avenue for cancer treatment.

            Changes in lipid composition and structure during cell development can be markers for cell apoptosis or various diseases such as cancer. 
            Although traditional fluorescence techniques utilising molecular probes have been studied, these methods are limited in studying these micro-changes as they require complex probe preparation and cannot be reused, making cell monitoring and detection challenging. 
            Here, we developed a direct current (DC) resistance sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322) nanosheets to enable cancer cell-specific detection dependent on micro-changes in the cancer cell membrane. 
            Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to study the interaction between 2D MoS&#8322 and cancer lipid bilayer systems, and revealed that previously unconsidered perturbations in the lipid bilayer can cause an increase in resistance. 
            Under an applied DC sweep, we observed an increase in resistance when cancer cells were incubated with the nanosheets. 
            Furthermore, a correlation was observed between the resistance and breast cancer epithelial cell (MCF-7) population, illustrating a cell population-dependent sensitivity of our method. 
            Our method has a detection limit of ∼3 × 10&#179 cells, below a baseline of ∼1 × 10&#8308 cells for the current state-of-the-art electrical-based biosensors using an adherent monolayer with homogenous cells. 
            This combination of a unique 2D material and electrical resistance framework represents a promising approach for the early detection of cancerous cells and to reduce the risk of post-surgery cancer recurrence.

            We observed a unique bioelectric signal of human embryonic stem cells using direct current–voltage measurements facilitated by few-layered 2D-MoS&#8322 sheets. 
            A 1.828 mA cell signal was achieved (2 orders of magnitude higher than previous electrical-based detection methods) as well as multiple cell reading cycles demonstrating I ∼ 1.9 mA. Native stem cell proliferation, viability, and pluripotency were preserved. 
            Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the origin of the 2D-MoS&#8322 sheet-assisted increase in current flow. 
            This paves the way for the development of a broadly applicable, fast, and damage-free stem cell detection method capable of identifying pluripotency with virtually any complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits.

            Long-term nondestructive monitoring of cells is of significant importance for understanding cell proliferation, cell signaling, cell death, and other processes. 
            However, traditional monitoring methods are limited to a certain range of testing conditions and may reduce cell viability. 
            Here, we present a microgap, multishot electroporation (M2E) system for monitoring cell recovery for up to ∼2 h using ∼5 V pulses and with excellent cell viability using a medium cell population. 
            Electric field simulations reveal the bias-voltage- and gap-size-dependent electric field intensities in the M2E system. 
            In addition to excellent transparency with low cell toxicity, the M2E system does not require specialized components, expensive materials, complicated fabrication processes, or cell manipulations; it just consists of a micrometer-sized pattern and a low-voltage square-wave generator. 
            Ultimately, the M2E system can offer a long-term and nontoxic method of cell monitoring.
